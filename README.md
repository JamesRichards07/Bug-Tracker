# Bug-Tracker

Rough Draft:

Features are ranked essential, semi-essential, and nice-to-have to give priority when building the program.

Essential Features to Include - Database, API, Basic UI, create new ticket, decription of ticket, and complete ticket.

Semi-Essential Feature to Include - Priority on tickets, references(links, screen shots, etc.) for the ticket, what dept/team/who the tickets are assigned to,                                           creation date/time, information overview of all tickets is sortable, different levels of permissions(dept head, team lead,                                           developer)

Nice-to-have - Search on all pages, elasped time on tickets, UI customization.
